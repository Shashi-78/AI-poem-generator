# AI-poem-generator
In recent years, artificial intelligence has shown remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating human language. This project, AI Poem Generator, explores the use of advanced natural language processing (NLP) models to automatically generate poetry in various forms, styles, and emotional tones. Leveraging deep learning techniques—particularly transformer-based models like GPT—the system can create original poems that mimic human creativity while adhering to thematic constraints provided by users. The objective is to blend artistic expression with machine intelligence, allowing users to generate personalized poems for education, entertainment, or creative writing assistance. This study also evaluates the generated poems in terms of fluency, coherence, and emotional resonance. The project demonstrates how AI can augment the creative process and inspire new forms of human-machine collaboration in the literary arts.
